look at timecourses, return to baseline


xx1. test folder
xx2. use tstat
xx3. add pca
4. larger radius : 20


add midthickness

xxuse cortex labels
mixture of gaussians and compare IC
do surface based fMRI analysis
xxdo 'prewhitening'
permutation and rsa

are some maps 0??




Find centers without spatiotemporal and then do spatiotemporal 

Fix volume searchlight nicely
Run fMRI
Revisar cada pas en les dades noves
Using euclidean and spatiotemporal: invcompactness is high in somatosensory and motor cortex!


Do I need to normalize the features (e. g. to 1 )

look at tutorial

shuffle (within each chunk)? and fit again and see if statistically significant, use parallel toolbox 
xx Plot MDS
Check consistency scores again

Remove outliers

Do spatiotemporal heatmap fig
put in fsaverage to plot better
Try Mahalanobis distance

try accuracy on extract

Run chunks separately and plot

Run the two hemispheres
Add and plot the decoding results
Check the multiclass
Run also volume searchlights
Look at trained vs untrained

xxPCA
xx add derivatives

xxxRun with 5 mm
xxPlot matrices
xxxCan use rest scans also when accuracy was bad
xxxDo maps of within, between and score
xxxGo back to Searchlight and try what you learned, also classification
xxxCheck decoding for spatio-temporal patterns ---> but think about timing issues!
xxRedo surface_searchlight with new thinking about zsxores
xxDo a loop with different vertices and their plots
xxTry multiclass and ridge
xxhow to use multivariate searchlight?

Do I improve sensitivity if I include more data?

xxCompute within vs between measure

At the end run also with GLM

xx Plot time courses

Check decoding as we move far away in time
